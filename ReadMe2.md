The four script files create a function for each of the plots:
- plot1()
- plot2()
- plot3()
- plot4()

Source the R script file, then call the function to generate the corresponding plot.

The entire data file is loaded each time the function is called, so it might take a minute or two for each of the functions to run. Patience is certainly welcomed. 
Thank you!
